Assignment submission includes - 
    - Greeting.jsx
    - UserInfo.jsx
    - TaskComponent.jsx
All within the component folder.

Additionally, App.jsx has been modified to import and render the listed components.

Note: Task 3 instructions do not specify the creation of the TaskComponent component. They do specifically direct the creation of an array of tasks inside the App component. So, I originally created the entire functionality of task 3 within the App component. Task 4 references the inclusion of a TaskComponent component which is not previously specified. Therefore, I had to choose which elements to move from App.jsx to TaskComponent.jsx.  I was unsure of whether to include getRandomTask() in the TaskComponent or in App.jsx. I tried to set it up to illustrate the use of props to send data into the component by using App.jsk to generate the random task and to send the props value from there to TaskComponent to generate the h3 output. I hope that is satisfactory.
